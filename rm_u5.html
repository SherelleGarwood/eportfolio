									<h2>Unit 5: Interviews and Survey Methods</h2>
									<h3>Reflective Activity</h3>
									<p> Cambridge Analytica was a political consulting firm that was in the news for obtaining and sharing data obtained from millions of Facebook users, during the 2016 United States presidential election (Cadwalladr, 2018). </p>
                  <p> Cambridge Analytica collected data was through a quizzes and surveys, one of which was an app called "thisisyourdigitallife" (Wagner, 2018). The app was designed by Aleksandr Kogan, a psychology professor at the University of Cambridge, and it collected not only the data of the people who used it but also the data of their friends. 
                    Using this data, Cambridge Analytica was able to build psychological profiles of individuals and use targeted advertising to influence their behaviour. 
                    This could be used to target voters with tailored messages. However, this was deemed as a misuse of personal data, leading to investigations by regulators in both the United States and the United Kingdom.</p>
                  <p> Another example of an inappropriate use of surveys occurred in the 1990s when the tobacco industry funded research studies that were designed to tone down the harmful effects of smoking (Brandt, 2012).
                    The surveys were meant to have been conducted by independent research firms, but in instead, they were crafted to produce results that would benefit the tobacco industry. </p>
                  <p> To summarise, Cambridge Analytica used surveys and other data collection methods to gather personal information that was then used to create detailed psychological profiles of individuals. 
                    These profiles were then used to target them with tailored advertising messages, which some have argued had a significant impact on the outcome of the 2016 United States presidential election.
                    Throughout history, there have been many other inappropriate uses of surveys by companies to collect data and mislead the public. </p>
