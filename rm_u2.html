									<h3>Collaborative Learning Discussion: Codes of Ethics and Professional Conduct (Peer Responses)</h3>
									<h3> Peer Response 1 </h3>
									<p> Hello Victoria, </p>
									<p> Thank you for your interesting and thoughtful post. </p>
									<p> As you previously described, Corazón implemented a basic security mechanism meaning that the implant ‘could only be accessible through short-range wireless connections’ (ACM, 2021). 
										This meant that the phone and implant had to be within close proximity, and any data transferred was encrypted. However, during a recent security conference, an independent researcher claimed to have found a vulnerability. </p>
									<p> Throughout the case study, it appears that Corazón has acted ethically in alignment with the BCS code of conduct. For example, principle 1a (public interest), states that companies should “have due regard for public health, privacy, security and wellbeing of others…” (BCS, 2022) . Corazón’s implants are aimed at helping individuals with heart disorders and they also work alongside charities to provide “free or reduced access to patients living below the poverty line” (ACM, 2021). The company also had an open bug program, meaning that they were open to feedback regarding the security of the system. 
										Although a vulnerability was found, it was decided that due to the limitations of the device, the risk of harm was negligible. </p>

									<h3> Peer Response 2 </h3>
									<p> Hello Mohammad, </p>
									<p> Thank you for your thoughtful and interesting post on the UX design case study. </p>
									<p> The study detailed a case of dark UX design. Stewart (a UX designer), received a request to redesign a website but soon realised that the changes were confusing and would lead to user’s buying products/additions that they were unaware of.
										The colours used for text was also difficult to user’s who were visually impaired, meaning that they were unable to read the disclaimers. </p>
									<p> As stated within your post, Stewart/ his manager and the client company have broken the BCS code of conduct. Multiple principles within section 1 (Public Interest) of the code of conduct, were broken, such as 1c, “conduct your professional activities without discrimination…” (ACM, 2018). The change of text colour was deliberately discriminatory to those who are visually impaired. 
										Although Stewart did flag these potential problems to his manager, it is clear that not enough was done to challenge the client about this. Through testing and evaluation after the implementation of the UX, Stewart/his manager, should have provided evidence of the dark design to prevent harm to users. </p>
