									<h2>Unit 7: Validity and Generalisability in Research</h2>
									<h3>Collaborative Learning Discussion: Accuracy of information (Initial Post) </h3>
									<p> Research regarding the nutritional values of food is an essential aspect of understanding the impact on health. Manufacturers often use nutritional research to support claims that their food product is nutritionally beneficial, and this can significantly increase sales (Bandy et al, 2019). 
                    Therefore, it is crucial that researchers maintain objectivity and impartiality in their analysis of nutritional data. </p>
                  <p> In regard to the scenario, if Abi changed data values in this study, it would be clear that this would acting unethically. However, it is still unethical for Abi to intentionally use the data for the purpose of supporting the manufacturer.
                    A list of recommendations provided by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors states that the release of medical findings “should not be influenced by commercial interests, personal relationships or agendas” (ICMJE, 2022). 
                    In Abi’s case, he would potentially be misrepresenting the findings for the benefit of manufacturer, which is a conflict of interest. </p>
                  <p> As the researcher, Abi is responsible for the findings, conclusions, and release of his work. He may not have full control over how the results are used by the manufacturer. However, he is responsible for providing a clear and accurate representation of his findings, which can only be done if they a presented objectively.
                    As a statistical programmer, Abi should be following the BCS code of conduct, which states that you should “have due regard for public health, privacy, security and wellbeing of others and the environment” and reject any “unethical inducement” (BCS, 2022). 
                    Abi should present his findings in full, so that the manufacturers are clear on the results of the study. If Abi is concerned that the finding will be misrepresented by the manufacturer, he should make clear the legal and ethical implications of this taking place. </p>
								  <p> To conclude, it is crucial that Abi’s findings are presented accurately and objectively in order to maintain the integrity of the study. Without this, the results of the findings will lose credibility and could potentially result in sanctions from his employer. </p>
