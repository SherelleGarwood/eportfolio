									<h3>Unit 1: Scientific Investigation and Ethics</h3>
									<h3>Collaborative Learning Discussion: Codes of Ethics and Professional Conduct</h3>
									<p> The ACM case study described a web hosting service called ‘Rogue services’. The majority of their clients were fraudulent services using Rogue to conduct ransomware attacks, and the dependability of the web hosting service was used by botnets to protect their servers. Despite requests from ISPs, Rogue did not protect against the use of these services, and there was no intervention from the government due to the laws within the host country of the company.

The BCS code of conduct outlines the professional standards that should be adhered to by those within the IT industry. When applying the BCS code of conduct to the case study, it is evident that Rogue violated principle 1a, stating that “you have due regard for public health, privacy, security and wellbeing of others” (BCS, 2022). This is due to the fact that Rogue was aware of the misuse of their services and failed to protect it. Rogue also violated principle 2f, “avoid injuring others, their property, reputation, or employment by false or malicious or negligent action or inaction” (BCS, 2022). Rogue’s inaction led to an increase in spam and botnet traffic.

Rogue was eventually taken offline through the use of a targeted worm, carried out by security vendors. No other ISP’s reported any impact from this. Although, the creation and implementation of malware would violate multiple code of conducts, this was a nuanced situation as the use of the worm was ‘ethically justified’ (ACM, 2018). This is in line with the moral obligation of IT professionals identified in principle 1a.

In this case study, the victims of the companies using Rogue services, had limited legal protection due to the country for which Rogue was hosted. Therefore, security vendors alongside governmental organisations used malware disruption to prevent further harm. </p>
