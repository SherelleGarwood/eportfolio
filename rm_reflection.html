                  <p> The research methods and professional practice module has been fundamental in developing my understanding of research methods that will enable me to conduct research in a practical setting. During the module, I submitted a literature review, research proposal and statistical method worksheets. I will be using Rolfe et al.'s (2001) Reflective framework to review and reflect upon my learning throughout the module.
                    Rolfe et al's reflective framework consists of three key stages: </p>
                  <ol>
                     <li>What: describing the experience or event that you are reflecting on.</li>
                      <li>So What: examining and evaluating the experience, considering how it affected you and what you learned from it.</li>
                      <li>Now What: exploring how you will apply what you learned to future situations.</li>
                    </ol>  
                  <p> The first summative assignment for the current module was a literature review. The literature review was based on the implementation of machine learning tools and techniques in crime prediction. The review covered a range of studies that explored different machine learning techniques and their ability to predict crime based upon pre-existing data.Through this literature review, I learned that the use of machine learning techniques is complex as it is an emerging field of study with limited scientific evidence for its use within this area. There were also many questions regarding the ethics of machine learning and potential algorithmic bias. For my literature review, I had decided to explore a field that I had limited previous knowledge in. This was challenging but very interesting to research. I performed well in my review; however, further criticality of the machine learning techniques could have been explored. I recognise the need for further research within the area but felt that I do not currently have enough knowledge within this field to add a valuable contribution through my capstone project. 
                    I decided to apply the research techniques I have learned so far and feedback from my tutor, to a capstone project within a different field of study. </p>
                  <p> The second summative assignment was a research proposal for my capstone project. The research proposal was questioning the effect of awareness training on the recognition of social engineering techniques. As a teacher, this area was of particular interest to me as education can often be seen as the most effective form of prevention. However, there is little prior research into the effectiveness of awareness training programs. The submission of the research proposal allowed me to plan the structure of the project and receive feedback regarding any improvements that could be made. This included further engagement with the literature to ascertain clearer objectives of the project. 
                    This will be used to improve my literature review within the next module. </p>
                  <p> Alongside the summative assignments, we were also asked to complete some statistical worksheets. The initial worksheet was based upon hypothesis testing, and I was able to carry out a two-tailed, test, one-tailed test and t-test. This showed the difference in means between two samples. I also completed a summary measures worksheet, in which I calculated the standard deviation and interquartile ranges for groups of data. The final worksheet allowed me to practice the creation of charts to provide a visual representation of the data. The worksheets were really helpful as the use of statistical measures on Excel is a new skill.
                    I will use these skills when completing the statistical analysis for my own project during the next module. </p>
                  <p>My knowledge and skills have definitely improved throughout this module. I have built on my confidence in research methods throughout the units. I also now have a stronger understanding of the ethics associated with carrying out research, as well as the basic principles of research design. I have had the opportunity to participate in collaborative discussions with my peers which has further improved my knowledge. </p>
                    Overall, this module has provided me with a valuable opportunity to gain further understanding of research methods and to consider how I can apply what I have learned to my personal and professional life.
