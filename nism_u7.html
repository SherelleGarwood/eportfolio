									<h3>Unit 7 Overview</h3>
									<p>During unit 7, we discussed how to gather, analyse and mitigate risks from a security audit session.</p>
									<h3>E-portfolio activity</h3>
                  <p> Kali Linux is a pre-packaged, open-source linux distribution used for penetration testing and computer forensics. It has become increasingly popular with white-hat (ethical hackers). One of the benefits of using Kali Linux is that it is free, making it widely accessible to those using Linux. The platform also has hundreds of penetrating testing tools, allowing in-depth information-gathering and analysis to take place. It also adheres to the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS), meaning that users are able to find support files and libraries to further support them during testing. However, Kali Linux is often considered to be difficult to use if you are new to Linux as an operating system, which may prevent some ethical hackers from using it. </p>
<p>Nessus is a remote security scanning tool, used to flag any vulnerabilities found within a device/network. Nessus is beneficial because it is consistently updated, which means that new vulnerabilities are quickly updated to their database, allowing for them to be scanned for. It is also free and open source, meaning that it is widely accessible and users are able to modify it to suit their needs. However, the tool does not always flag vulnerabilities correctly meaning that the user will need to check and verify the vulnerability, which can often be time-consuming.</p>
<p>Both Kali Linux and Nessus are widely used by ethical hackers and are both considered to be beneficial. Kali Linux is especially useful for those who are fluent users of Linux. Whereas, Nessus is more user friendly but not necessarily allow for the same level of precision.</p>
