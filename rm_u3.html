									<h2>Unit 3: Research Methods</h2>
									<h3>Collaborative Learning Discussion: Codes of Ethics and Professional Conduct (Summary Post)</h3>
									<p> Thank you to those who thoughtfully responded to my initial post regarding the ACM case study based on a web hosting service called ‘Rogue services’. As Zihaad stated, the case raises important ethical questions about the use of malware as a means of disruption. Malware may sometimes be used for investigative purposes by law enforcement or other government agencies. 
                    However, there seems to be limited research into this area or best practice guidelines for when/how this should be allowed to take place. As Kate questioned in her response, the use of malware may not be most ethical. There may have been other solutions such as warrant allowing legal enforcement of the ’Rogue services’ network, to take down their servers. 
                    However, this may have been difficult due to the host country not being supportive of legal action so far. </p>
                  <p> Overall, I believe that all solutions should have been explored prior to the use of malware to disrupt the server at ‘Rogue services’. This may have included other forms of legal action towards the company. 
                    However, the actual use of the malware is in line with the moral obligation of IT professionals identified in principle 1a of the BCS code of conduct (BCS, 2022) and is considered to be “ethically justified” by the ACM (ACM, 2018). </p>
