									<h3>Unit 5 Overview</h3>
									<p>During unit 5, we reviewed the functions of the wide variety of network components such as switches, routers, firewalls and gateways.</p>
									<h3>Peer Response: Team scanning exercise</h3>
                  <p> Thank you for sharing your scan results. They appear to be similar to the results of my individual scan and that of some of my team members. Your team located the hosting country to be the United states of America. This was the conclusion I had initially made during scanning. However, our team has debated the reliability of generic IP address locaters, as  they are known to be fairly inaccurate. Kevin (team member) suggested to use the route naming convention, the complete route information and the hop times. Through this, we arrived at the conclusion that the website was actually hosted in Amsterdam- which was the location of one of the hops found whilst using the TRACERT command.
My suggestion would be to carry out another in-depth search for the hosting country, with this information in mind and see if you and your team arrive at the same conclusion.
