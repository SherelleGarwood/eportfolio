									<h3>Collaborative Learning Discussion: Accuracy of Information (Peer Responses)</h3>
                  <h3> Peer Response 1 </h3>
                  <p> Hello Emmanuel, </p>
                  <p> Thank you for your thoughtful post. </p>
                  <p> As you stated, Abi's situation raises ethical concerns about the accuracy of data in research.
                    Abi has a responsibility to present unbiased information, regardless of his findings and therefore it is unethical to present them in a way that is preferable to the company she is working for. </p>
                  <p> Once research is published, it becomes part of the public domain, and anyone can use it. Researchers cannot always control how their findings are used, but they are responsible for providing a clear and accurate representation.
                    Do you feel that Abi should report the possible misuse of data to the relevant authorities? If so, do you believe that this is a moral or professional obligation? </p>
                  <h3> Peer Response 2 </h3>
                  <p> Hello Mohammad, </p>
                  <p> Thank you for your thoughtful post. </p>
                  <p> I agreed with many of the points that you presented, however, I noticed that you wrote that Abi “can’t be responsible for the way that data is used” (Atieh, 2023). Why do you feel that Abi would not be responsible? 
                    I do believe that there is an interesting conversation to be had about whether this is a moral or professional obligation. I look forward to hearing your opinion on this. </p>
                  <p> Researchers often need to be involved in the analysis and interpretation of data before it is presented to the stakeholders. 
                    As a statistical programmer, Abi should be following the BCS code of conduct, which states that you should “have due regard for public health, privacy, security and wellbeing of others and the environment” and reject any “unethical inducement” (BCS, 2022).</p>

                      <p>Introduction</p>
			    <ul>
				    <li> Research title: ‘Security through education: The use and effectiveness of awareness training in preventing social engineering attacks.’ </li>
			    </ul>
                      <p>The research problem and contribution to the field:</p>
			    	    <ul>
				    <li> Social engineering is the most common cyber threat factor for UK business (Department for digital, culture, media & sport, 2022). </li>
					<li> The research may contribute to the discipline by: Advancing knowledge, evaluating the effectiveness of training and promote interdisciplinary collaboration. </li>
			    </ul>
			    
                      <p>The research question </p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>What is the impact of awareness training on the ability of individuals to recognise social engineering attacks, and how can these programs be optimised to maximise their effectiveness? </li>
                
                      </ul>

			<ul>
                        <li> Aim: A review and analysis of social engineering awareness training and to assess the effectiveness of awareness training in preventing social engineering attacks.</li>
                	<li> Objectives: 
				<p>To investigate the different types of awareness training used to prevent social engineering attacks and evaluate their effectiveness. </p>
				<p>To identify the factors that influence the effectiveness of awareness training in preventing social engineering attacks, such as program design and delivery.</p>
				<p>To assess the level of awareness among individuals about social engineering and their ability to recognise these attacks. </p>
