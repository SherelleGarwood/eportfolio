									<h3>Collaborative Learning Discussion: Accuracy of Information (Peer Responses)</h3>
                  <h3> Peer Response 1 </h3>
                  <p> Hello Emmanuel, </p>
                  <p> Thank you for your thoughtful post. </p>
                  <p> As you stated, Abi's situation raises ethical concerns about the accuracy of data in research.
                    Abi has a responsibility to present unbiased information, regardless of his findings and therefore it is unethical to present them in a way that is preferable to the company she is working for. </p>
                  <p> Once research is published, it becomes part of the public domain, and anyone can use it. Researchers cannot always control how their findings are used, but they are responsible for providing a clear and accurate representation.
                    Do you feel that Abi should report the possible misuse of data to the relevant authorities? If so, do you believe that this is a moral or professional obligation? </p>
                  <h3> Peer Response 2 </h3>
                  <p> Hello Mohammad, </p>
                  <p> Thank you for your thoughtful post. </p>
                  <p> I agreed with many of the points that you presented, however, I noticed that you wrote that Abi “can’t be responsible for the way that data is used” (Atieh, 2023). Why do you feel that Abi would not be responsible? 
                    I do believe that there is an interesting conversation to be had about whether this is a moral or professional obligation. I look forward to hearing your opinion on this. </p>
                  <p> Researchers often need to be involved in the analysis and interpretation of data before it is presented to the stakeholders. 
                    As a statistical programmer, Abi should be following the BCS code of conduct, which states that you should “have due regard for public health, privacy, security and wellbeing of others and the environment” and reject any “unethical inducement” (BCS, 2022).</p>
