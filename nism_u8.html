									<h3>Unit 8 Overview</h3>
									<p>During unit 8, we reviewed and discussed a number of GDPR related case studies.</p>
									<h3>E-portfolio activity: GDPR Case Study</h3>
                  <p> <b> What is the specific aspect of GDPR that your case study addresses? </b> </p>
<p>An individual had received his motor insurance renewal quotation from his current insurance provider and wanted to search for a better quotation. AA Ireland limited was one of the companies that he contacted. He was assured that his data would not be used for marketing purposes but he had received unsolicited marketing text messages from the company. AA was not using the indiviualâ€™s information only for the purposes for which it was collected, which is against regulations.</p>
<p><b>How was it resolved?</p></b>
<p>The Data Protection Commission initiated proceedings and AA Ireland Limited pleaded guilty. They also agreed to cover prosecution costs incurred.</p>
<p><b>If this was your organisation what steps would you take as an Information Security Manager to mitigate the issue?</p></b>
<p>Ensure that GDPR is followed at all times by educating all staff with regular training.</p>
